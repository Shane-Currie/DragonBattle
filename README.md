Video Game, Video updates: https://shanesonline.com/professional/Dragon_battle.html

___EARLY_BETA VERSION_ This game is currently in development and is not yet complete.____
Dragon Battle is a text-based game where the player can explore multiple locations and fight various enemies.
Enemies have a basic AI system and encountered enemies have randomised stats in attack, health and agility. I will be adding more features on the enemy AI such as enemy decision making capabilities based on the enemies confidence, anger and fear.

The script has been developed so other users can add in new locations or features.  If you want to do this, read the readme file located within version directory.

If youâ€™re going to made edits to my script, your welcome to do so, just share me the link to edited script.

This is a very early release of the game, I will be making future advancements to the game. Read the readme.file located within the most recent game version directory for updates.

CYBER SECUIRTY TIP! Never run scripts on your host computer, use a hypervisor or windows sandbox.
Have fun editing my script if you choose to do so.
